AWS head cat issue



```bash
env | grep AWS | cat
```

```bash
env | grep PAGER | cat
```

Root cause found — it’s the global PAGER variable the tool injects.

What’s happening
1. The terminal-execution tool that drives your shell session exports
   ```
   PAGER="head -n 10000 | cat"
   ```
   (We just confirmed that with `env | grep PAGER`).

2. AWS CLI decides which pager to use in this order:  
   • cli config value → `AWS_PAGER` env → **`PAGER` env** → default `less -R`.

3. Because `PAGER` is set, AWS CLI launches a pager.  
   Internally it *shlex-splits* the value and then runs it with
   `subprocess.Popen(pager_cmd, …, shell=False)`.  
   That turns the string into the argv list  
   `['head', '-n', '10000', '|', 'cat']`, so the literal “|” and “cat”
   are taken as filenames.  
   Result:  
   ```
   head: |: No such file or directory
   head: cat: No such file or directory
   ```

Why you only see it through the tool
Your own interactive zsh doesn’t have `PAGER` set that way, so AWS CLI
falls back to no pager (stdout isn’t a TTY) and everything works.

Two simple fixes you can adopt immediately
A. Add the standard CLI switch that bypasses the pager:
   ```
   aws <service> <command> ... --output json --no-cli-pager
   ```
   or shorter:
   ```
   aws --no-cli-pager ...
   ```

B. Explicitly clear the pager for the one command:
   ```
   AWS_PAGER="" aws <service> <command> ...
   ```

Permanent solutions (pick one)
1. Tell the assistant to append `--no-cli-pager` (or set `AWS_PAGER=""`)
   whenever it runs AWS CLI commands.

2. Re-configure the execution tool so it no longer exports
   `PAGER="head -n 10000 | cat"`; it can still pipe git/less/tail output
   itself when needed, without poisoning other programs that respect
   the pager variable.

Either way, the erroneous “head: | / cat: No such file or directory”
messages will disappear and the JSON will flow as expected.
