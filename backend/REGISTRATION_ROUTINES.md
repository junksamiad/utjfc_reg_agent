---

## **Routine 2: Child Name Collection**

**Task**: Your current task is to: 
1. Take the child's first and last name which should result in at least 2 parts (first name + last name)

6. If address returned successfully, set `routine_number = 15` and show them the formatted address asking for confirmation that it's correct

**🔧 Tool Calling Flow**: This routine uses the two-step API call pattern - first call makes the tool call, second call processes results and branches accordingly.

---

## **Routine 14: Manual Address Entry (Fallback)**

**Task**: Your current task is to: 
1. Take the parent's manually entered full address
2. Do a visual check to ensure it looks like a valid UK address format: has house number/name, street name, area/town, and UK postcode (2 letters, 1-2 numbers, space, 1 number, 2 letters like M32 8JL)
3. Check it includes Manchester/Stretford/Urmston area or other recognizable UK location
4. If the address looks incomplete, badly formatted, or not UK, set `routine_number = 14` and ask for a more complete address
5. If the address looks reasonable and complete, set `routine_number = 15` and show them the address asking for confirmation that it's correct

**🧠 Smart Validation**: Uses agent's knowledge instead of Google API to avoid validation loops when API lookup failed.

---

## **Routine 15: Address Confirmation**

**Task**: Your current task is to: 
1. Take the response about whether the shown address is correct
2. Accept Yes/No response (normalize 'yes', 'correct', 'right', 'that's it' to 'Yes' and 'no', 'wrong', 'not right', 'incorrect' to 'No')
3. If they say No or the address is wrong, set `routine_number = 14` and ask them to provide their correct full address manually
4. If they confirm Yes or the address is correct, set `routine_number = 16` and ask if {child_name} lives at the same address

---

## **Routine 16: Child Address Check**

**Task**: Your current task is to: 
1. Take the response about whether {child_name} lives at the same address as the parent

3. If unclear response or can't determine Yes/No, set `routine_number = 16` and ask for clarification
4. **If Yes, set `routine_number = 22` (DO NOT ask a question - server will handle age-based routing)**
5. If No, set `routine_number = 18` and ask for {child_name}'s address

**🔄 Server-Side Routing**: When routine 22 is set, the server intercepts and loops back to process age-based routing automatically.

---

6. If address returned successfully, set `routine_number = 21` and show them the formatted address asking for confirmation that it's {child_name}'s correct address

**🔧 Tool Calling Flow**: Uses the same two-step API call pattern as parent address collection.

3. Check it includes Manchester/Stretford/Urmston area or other recognizable UK location
4. If the address looks incomplete, badly formatted, or not UK, set `routine_number = 20` and ask for a more complete address for {child_name}
5. If the address looks reasonable and complete, set `routine_number = 21` and show them the address asking for confirmation that it's {child_name}'s correct address

**🧠 Smart Validation**: Uses agent's knowledge instead of Google API to avoid validation loops when API lookup failed.

3. If they say No or the address is wrong, set `routine_number = 20` and ask them to provide {child_name}'s correct full address manually
4. **If they confirm Yes or the address is correct, set `routine_number = 22` (server will handle age-based routing)**

---

## **🎯 Routine 22: Age-Based Routing Hub**

**Task**: Your current task is to: 
1. Look through the conversation history for age group information (look for 'Age group: U##' in system messages)
2. **If age group is U16 or above**, set `routine_number = 23` and explain that since {child_name} is 16+, you need to take a telephone number and email for them which is different from their parents telephone number and email, then ask if you can start by taking {child_name}'s mobile phone number
3. **If age group is under U16**, set `routine_number = 28` and thank them for all the information they have given you so far, list all the info you have collected and ask them to confirm all the details are correct

**🔄 Server Logic**: This routine is triggered by server-side detection and automatically processes age-based routing.

## **Available Validation Tools**

- ✅ `address_lookup` - Used in routines 13 & 19 (Google Places API postcode + house number lookup)
- 🧠 **Smart Agent Validation** - Used in routines 14 & 20 (Visual address format checking without API calls)
- 🔧 `postcode_validation` - Available for routines 12 & 18 (if needed for simple postcode validation)
- ⚠️ `address_validation` - Available but not used in main flow (can cause validation loops)

## **Key Principles**

1. **Silent Validation**: Never explicitly mention validation checks to parents
2. **Embedded Validation**: Most validation is now built into routine prompts for speed (routines 1-5, 7-13, 16)
3. **📧 GDPR Compliance**: Always ask for explicit consent for communications after collecting email (routine 10)
4. **🚨 Medical Safety Priority**: When serious medical conditions are mentioned (EpiPen, inhaler, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.), always ask detailed emergency questions about medication location, procedures, and triggers
5. **Smart Address Collection**: Multi-step address process (postcode → house number → Google API lookup → confirmation)
6. **Function Validation**: Only address lookup and fallback validation use function calls (routines 13, 15)
7. **Age-Based Routing**: Server-side intelligence automatically routes based on player age group from registration code
8. **Ask Next Question at End**: Always ask the next question when setting the next routine_number
9. **One Step at a Time**: Collect one piece of information per conversation turn
10. **User-Friendly**: Accept variations and normalize responses
11. **Error Recovery**: Stay on same routine if validation fails, move forward if successful
12. **Structured Data**: Ensure all collected data is properly formatted for Airtable storage
