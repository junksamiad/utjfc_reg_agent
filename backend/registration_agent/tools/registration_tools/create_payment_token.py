    Create a GoCardless billing request for UTJFC player registration.
    
    This creates both a one-off payment request (signing fee) and a mandate request 
    (monthly subscription) in a single billing request. Returns the billing_request_id
    which can be used later to create payment links when the user is ready to pay.

        player_full_name (str): Full name of the player being registered
        team_name (str): Team the player is joining

        parent_phone (str): Phone number of parent/guardian
        signing_fee_amount (int): One-off signing fee in pence (default: 100 = Â£1.00 for testing)
