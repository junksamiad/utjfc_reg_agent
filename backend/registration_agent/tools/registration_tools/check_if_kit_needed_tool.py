    This tool queries the team_info database to determine whether a specific team 
    and age group combination requires new kit for the current season. It's used 
    in routine 30 to implement smart kit routing logic.
    
    The tool should be called when:
    - A returning player (played for Urmston Town last season) is registering
    - After SMS payment link confirmation in routine 30
    - To determine if they need kit selection (routine 32) or can skip to photo upload (routine 34)
    
    The agent should extract team and age group information from the conversation history
    where this data was injected as system messages when the registration code was validated.
    
    Returns whether new kit is required ('Y') or not required ('N') for routing decisions.
