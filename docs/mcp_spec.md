You're absolutely right to question this! Let me re-read the MCP documentation more carefully.

Read file: docs/mcp_setup.md

Read file: docs/mcp_setup.md

Read file: docs/mcp_setup.md

Read file: docs/openai_built_in_mcp.md
You're absolutely correct! After reading the documentation more carefully, I need to revise my recommendation. Here's what I found:

## 🔍 Key Findings from the Documentation

### Transport Protocol Clarification

1. **OpenAI's Responses API Support**: The OpenAI documentation clearly states:
   > "The Responses API supports remote MCP servers that support either the **Streamable HTTP** or the **HTTP/SSE transport protocol**."

2. **MCP SDK Documentation**: While it mentions that "Streamable HTTP transport is superseding SSE transport for production deployments," it also shows that:
   - **SSE is still fully supported** and widely used
   - **Default mounting**: "SSE servers are mounted at `/sse` and Streamable HTTP servers are mounted at `/mcp`"
   - **Both transports are production-ready**

### Recommendation: Start with SSE

Given your requirements and the current ecosystem, I recommend **starting with SSE transport** for these reasons:

1. **OpenAI Compatibility**: Both SSE and Streamable HTTP work with OpenAI's Responses API
2. **Simplicity**: SSE is simpler to set up and debug initially
3. **Ecosystem Maturity**: More examples and existing servers use SSE
4. **Easy Migration Path**: You can always migrate to Streamable HTTP later if needed

## 🚀 Revised Implementation Plan

### AWS Deployment Recommendation
For AWS, I'd recommend **AWS App Runner** for your use case:
- **Pros**: Automatic scaling, container support, simple deployment from GitHub
- **Alternative**: ECS Fargate if you need more control
- **Budget Option**: EC2 t3.micro with Docker

### Updated Server Structure
```
backend/mcp_server/
├── server.py              # Main MCP server (SSE transport)
├── requirements.txt       # Dependencies including mcp[cli]
├── Dockerfile            # For containerization
├── tools/                # Migrated tools
│   └── airtable/        # Your existing Airtable tool
├── .env.example         # Environment template
└── README.md            # Setup instructions
```

### Implementation Code (SSE Transport)
```python
# server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP
from tools.airtable.mcp_airtable_tool import setup_airtable_tools
import os

# Create MCP server
mcp = FastMCP(
    name="UTJFC Registration MCP Server",
    dependencies=["pyairtable", "openai", "python-dotenv"]
)

# Register tools
setup_airtable_tools(mcp)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Use SSE transport (default)
    port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8002))
    mcp.run(transport="sse", port=port)
```

### OpenAI Integration (Updated)
```python
# Your main agent will connect via SSE
response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    tools=[{
        "type": "mcp",
        "server_label": "utjfc_registration",
        "server_url": "http://localhost:8002/sse",  # SSE endpoint
        "require_approval": "never",
        "allowed_tools": ["airtable_database_operation"]
    }],
    input=user_message
)
```

## 📋 Updated Migration Steps

1. **Create MCP Server with SSE**: Start with SSE transport for simplicity
2. **Port 8002**: Perfect choice for local development
3. **Docker Container**: Prepare for easy deployment to Replit/AWS
4. **No Auth Initially**: Keep it simple, add later
5. **Future Extensibility**: Structure for additional tools

Would you like me to proceed with implementing the MCP server using **SSE transport**? This gives us the best balance of simplicity, compatibility, and future flexibility. We can always migrate to Streamable HTTP later if you need the additional features it provides.
