# New Features Directory

This directory contains feature specification documents for new functionality being developed for the UTJFC Registration Agent system.

## New Organizational Structure

As of July 2025, we've implemented a new organizational structure for better maintainability and scalability:

### Per-Feature Directory Structure
Each feature now has its own dedicated directory containing:

```
feature-name/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                    # Feature overview and testing instructions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ feature_specification.md    # Complete feature documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ implementation_plan.md      # Technical implementation details
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                      # All test scripts for the feature
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_comprehensive.py   # Main test suite
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_database_lookup.py # Database-specific tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_tool_integration.py # Tool registration tests
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_manual.py          # Interactive testing utility
```

### Migration from Old Structure

**OLD (Deprecated)**:
- Individual `.md` files in root `new_features/` directory
- Mixed documentation and implementation files
- No organized testing structure

**NEW (Current)**:
- Per-feature directories with complete documentation
- Dedicated test directories for each feature
- Clear separation of concerns
- Scalable structure for future features

## Document Guidelines

### File Naming Convention

- **In Development**: `feature_name.md`
- **Implemented**: `feature_name_IMPLEMENTED.md`
- **Cancelled/Deprecated**: `feature_name_CANCELLED.md`

### Document Structure

All feature documents should follow this standardized structure:

#### Header Section
```markdown
# Feature Name

**Feature ID**: `kebab-case-feature-id`  
**Status**: [Planning|In Development|Testing|Implemented|Cancelled]  
**Priority**: [Low|Medium|High|Critical]  
**Estimated Effort**: [e.g., "2-3 hours", "1-2 days", "1 week"]  
**Dependencies**: [List any dependencies or "None"]  
**Implementation Date**: [YYYY-MM-DD] (when implemented)  
**Implemented By**: [Developer/AI agent name] (when implemented)  
**Branch**: [feature branch name] (when implemented)  

---
```

#### Core Sections

   - **Verification Steps**: How to confirm successful deployment

8. **Future Considerations**
   - **Extensibility**: How this feature might evolve
   - **Maintenance**: Ongoing support requirements
   - **Related Features**: What other features might build on this

#### Implementation Details Section (for IMPLEMENTED features)

When a feature is implemented, add this section:

9. **Implementation Details**
   - **Implementation Summary**: What was actually built
   - **Files Modified**: List of changed files with descriptions
   - **Testing Recommendations**: How to test the implemented feature
   - **Notes**: Any deviations from the original plan

### Status Definitions

- **Planning**: Feature requirements being defined
- **In Development**: Actively being coded
- **Testing**: Implementation complete, undergoing testing
- **Implemented**: Successfully deployed and working
- **Cancelled**: Feature development discontinued

### Priority Definitions

- **Critical**: System breaking issue, immediate attention required
- **High**: Important feature for business goals, next sprint priority
- **Medium**: Valuable improvement, can be scheduled
- **Low**: Nice to have, lowest scheduling priority

### Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: Include exact file paths, function names, and technical details
2. **Consider Dependencies**: Think about how changes affect other parts of the system
3. **Plan for Testing**: Define clear testing strategies before implementation
4. **Document Decisions**: Explain why certain approaches were chosen
5. **Keep Updated**: Modify documents as requirements change during development
6. **Version Control**: Commit feature documents alongside code changes

### Templates

For quick feature creation, copy the structure from `extend_kit_number_range_IMPLEMENTED.md` for smaller features or `automated_payment_chasing.md` for larger, complex features.

### Important Implementation Reminder

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL FINAL STEP**: After any feature is deployed and tested successfully, agents must:

1. **Review System Documentation**: Check `/Users/leehayton/Cursor Projects/utjfc_reg_agent/system_docs/` for any documentation that needs updating
2. **Update Relevant Documents**: Look for files that might need updates based on the new feature:
   - Architecture diagrams
   - API documentation
   - Process flow documents
   - Technical specifications
   - User guides
3. **Update Implementation Plan**: Add a final section documenting what system documentation was updated

This ensures the codebase documentation stays current and accurate for future development.

## Directory Organization

### Status-Based Organization Structure

Features are now organized by development status using numbered directories for clear lifecycle management:

```
new_features/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 01_PLANNING/           # Features in planning/specification phase
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 02_IN_DEVELOPMENT/     # Features actively being developed
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 03_IMPLEMENTED/        # Completed and deployed features
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 04_CANCELLED/          # Discontinued features (for reference)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md              # This documentation
```

### Feature Structure
Each feature should have its own directory containing:
- `feature_specification.md` - Main feature documentation
- `implementation_plan.md` - Technical implementation details
- `tests/` - All test scripts for the feature
- `README.md` - Feature overview and testing instructions

### Current Features by Status

#### üìã 01_PLANNING
- `automated_payment_chasing.md` - Automated payment follow-up system
  - **Status**: Planning phase
  - **Priority**: Medium
- `photo_resize_optimization/` - Photo resizing for FA portal compliance
  - **Status**: Planning phase - comprehensive specification complete
  - **Branch**: `feature/resize-photos`
  - **Priority**: High

#### üîß 02_IN_DEVELOPMENT  
- *(No features currently in active development)*

#### ‚úÖ 03_IMPLEMENTED
- `restart_chat_if_disconnected/` - Resume registration after disconnection
  - **Status**: Deployed v1.6.22
  - **Branch**: Merged to dev
  - **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite

  - **Status**: Deployed in production
  - **Legacy Format**: Migrated from old structure

#### ‚ùå 04_CANCELLED
- *(No cancelled features yet)*

### Status Migration Process

When a feature changes status:

1. **Planning ‚Üí In Development**: Move from `01_PLANNING/` to `02_IN_DEVELOPMENT/`
2. **In Development ‚Üí Implemented**: Move from `02_IN_DEVELOPMENT/` to `03_IMPLEMENTED/`
3. **Any Status ‚Üí Cancelled**: Move to `04_CANCELLED/` with cancellation notes

### Naming Convention
- **Directory Names**: Use snake_case (e.g., `resize_photos/`)
- **Status Tracking**: Directory location indicates current status
- **Legacy Files**: Keep original naming until next migration
- **Branch Names**: Use kebab-case (e.g., `feature/resize-photos`)
