## Implementation Details

### Step 1: Core Function Implementation ✅
**Following Architecture Pattern**:
- Created separate core function file for business logic
- Implemented exact name matching using computed Airtable fields
- Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- Returns structured data for routing decisions

### Step 2: Tool Definition ✅
**Following Established Pattern**:
- Created OpenAI tool definition file
- Implemented handler wrapper function
- Generated proper function schema for AI
- Added comprehensive parameter descriptions

### Step 3: Routine Logic Update ✅
**Modified Routine 2 Steps 5-8**:
```
5) if valid, call function check_if_record_exists_in_db which will see if this is a returning user or not. If they are not a returning user (ie a record match IS NOT returned) then set routine_number = 3 and ask for their child's date of birth.

6) in the returned record, check the value of the field 'played_for_urmston_town_last_season'. If the value is 'N', set routine_number = 32, then ask them to choose a kit size for their child...

7) If the 'played_for_urmston_town_last_season' value is 'Y', then call the function check_if_kit_needed to see whether their team is due a new kit. If the result returned = 'N', then set routine = 34 and explain that next they need to upload a passport-style photo...

8) If the result returned from the check_if_kit_needed function = 'Y', then, set routine_number = 32, then ask them to choose a kit size for their child...
```

### Step 4: Tool Integration ✅
**Complete Integration**:
- Added to package exports in `__init__.py`
- Registered in agent tool definitions
- Added function handlers
- Updated registration agent tools list

## Testing Strategy - COMPLETED ✅

   - Tool registration verification
   - Function execution with test data
   - Real database lookup (Lee Hayton / Seb Hayton)
   - Error handling validation
   - Routine 2 update verification
   - Tool schema validation

2. **`test_database_lookup.py`** - Database-specific tests:
   - Known record lookup
   - Non-existent record handling
   - Name variation testing
   - Error condition testing

3. **`test_tool_integration.py`** - Integration tests:
   - Package import verification
   - Agent registration testing

3. **Documentation**: Feature specification updated
4. **Branch**: Ready on `feature/restart-chat-if-disconnected`

### Deployment Process (When Ready)
```bash
# 1. Commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement registration resume for disconnected users"

# 2. Push to origin
git push origin feature/restart-chat-if-disconnected

# 5. Merge to dev branch after verification
```

## Risk Mitigation - ADDRESSED ✅

### ✅ Database Performance
- **Efficient Queries**: Uses computed fields for exact matching
- **Limited Results**: Restricts to single record lookup
- **Proper Indexing**: Leverages existing Airtable indexing

### ✅ Name Matching Accuracy
- **Exact Matching**: Uses conservative exact name matching
- **Proper Capitalization**: Maintains database format consistency
- **Clear Error Messages**: Provides helpful feedback for mismatches

### ✅ Backward Compatibility
- **New User Flow**: Unchanged for new registrations
- **Existing Logic**: All existing routines remain functional
- **Fallback Mechanism**: Graceful degradation if lookup fails

## Critical Issues Discovered and Fixed During Implementation

### 🚨 **AWS Credentials Issue**
**Problem**: After initial deployment, photo uploads were failing due to missing/invalid AWS credentials in production environment.

**Investigation**: 
- DNS resolution errors initially misdiagnosed
- Root cause: Invalid AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (`AKIAZSWMTGHRFGDAFCPK`) in production
- Photo uploads to S3 were failing with "The AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records"

**Solution**:
- Updated production environment with correct AWS credentials (see aws_credentials_reference.md)
- Created secure credential reference file with .gitignore protection
- Updated deployment guide with environment variable verification checklist

### 🚨 **Record ID Missing in Database Updates**
**Problem**: Photo upload database updates were failing with "Record ID rec... not found" errors.

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- `check_if_record_exists_in_db` function returned record fields but NOT the record ID
- Record ID was available (`record['id']`) but not included in return statement
- Later functions (upload_photo_to_s3, update_photo_link_to_db) expected record_id in conversation history

**Solution**:
- Fixed `check_if_record_exists_in_db.py` line 101 to include: `"record_id": record['id']`
- Tool call results now include record ID for subsequent database operations
- Photo uploads and database updates now work correctly for resumed registrations

### 📋 **Implementation Lessons Learned**
1. **Environment Variable Verification**: Always verify ALL environment variables after deployment
2. **Complete Return Data**: Ensure tool functions return all necessary data for subsequent operations
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Test complete workflows, not just individual components
4. **Secure Credential Management**: Use separate files with .gitignore for sensitive information
