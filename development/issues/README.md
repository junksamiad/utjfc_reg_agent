# Development Issues Tracker

This folder contains detailed technical issues and improvements for the UTJFC Registration System. Each issue is documented comprehensively to allow any developer to understand and implement the solution.

## Purpose

The issues folder serves as a structured way to document:
- Technical debt that needs addressing
- System improvements and optimizations
- Configuration issues and security concerns
- Bug fixes with detailed analysis and solutions

## Issue Naming Convention

Each issue follows the format: `ISSUE-XXX-[STATUS]-component-brief-description.md`

- `XXX` - Sequential issue number (001, 002, etc.)
- `[STATUS]` - Current status: `[OPEN]`, `[IN-PROGRESS]`, `[RESOLVED]`, or `[CLOSED]`
- `component` - The system component (frontend, backend, registration, mcp, etc.)
- `brief-description` - Short kebab-case description

### Examples:
- `ISSUE-001-[OPEN]-frontend-environment-config.md`
- `ISSUE-002-[CLOSED]-photo-upload-413-error.md`
- `ISSUE-003-[IN-PROGRESS]-backend-retry-mechanism.md`

## Issue Document Structure

Each issue document must contain:

### 1. Header Information
```markdown
**Priority**: Critical/High/Medium/Low
**Type**: Bug/Feature/Configuration/Security/Performance
**Component**: Affected system component
**Created**: Date created
**Status**: Current status
```

### 2. Executive Summary
Brief overview of the issue and its impact

### 3. Current Implementation
- Code snippets showing current problematic state
- Specific file locations and line numbers
- Configuration details

### 4. Problems Identified
- Detailed explanation of what's wrong
- Security, performance, or functionality impacts
- Root cause analysis

### 5. Proposed Solution
- Step-by-step implementation guide
- Code examples and snippets
- Configuration changes required
- Migration steps if needed

### 6. Implementation Checklist
Actionable items with checkboxes for tracking progress

### 7. Testing Instructions
- How to verify the fix works
- Test scenarios to cover
- Expected outcomes

### 8. Additional Context
- Related documentation links
- Infrastructure considerations
- External dependencies
- References and resources

## Creating New Issues

When documenting a new issue:

1. **Use the next sequential number** - Check existing files to determine next number
2. **Follow the naming convention** - Ensure consistent format
3. **Include all required sections** - Use the template structure above
4. **Be comprehensive** - Provide enough detail for any developer to implement
5. **Include code examples** - Show current state and proposed changes
6. **Add actionable checklists** - Break down implementation into steps

## Issue Priority Guidelines

- **Critical**: System breaking, security vulnerabilities, data loss risk
- **High**: Major functionality impaired, poor user experience
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues, improvements needed
- **Low**: Nice-to-have features, minor optimizations

## Status Lifecycle

- **Open**: Issue identified and documented, not yet started
- **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
- **Resolved**: Solution implemented, awaiting testing/verification
- **Closed**: Verified, tested, and deployed to production

## Best Practices

- **One issue per file** - Keep issues focused and manageable
- **Update status** - Rename files when status changes
- **Reference commits** - Link to commits that resolve issues
- **Cross-reference** - Link related issues and documentation
- **Archive completed** - Consider moving closed issues to archive folder
